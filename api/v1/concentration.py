    Asynchronous WebSocket endpoint to manage a concentration monitoring session.

    This endpoint serves as a communication hub for WebSocket connections that focus on tracking
    and managing user concentration. It leverages the ConcentrationService to handle the complex
    logic related to concentration states in real-time.

    Args:
        websocket (WebSocket): The WebSocket connection object provided by FastAPI, used to send and receive data.
        concentration_service (ConcentrationService): An instance of ConcentrationService handling the logic,
                                                      automatically injected by FastAPI using the Depends mechanism.

    The functionâ€™s main role is to maintain the WebSocket communication for concentration monitoring. Once a connection
    is established, it passes the responsibility to the ConcentrationService, which processes and manages the data
    received via WebSocket.
